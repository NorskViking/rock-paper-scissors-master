## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

During this project I've been able to deepen my knowledge of Typescript, and learned how to use TailwindCSS for styling my components. 


### Continued development

In the future I plan on keep deepening my knowledge in Typescript and Tailwind, and the Javascript framework in general. I have some fullstack PERN projects in mind, where I will make use of freely available RestAPI's. 

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss.org](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The documentation is well written and easy to understand, which made it easy for me to learn how to use it for styling.
- [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) - They have many well written guides and articles, that help me when I got stuck in places. One of their articles helped me solve a problem I had with z-index not seemingly working as intended.
